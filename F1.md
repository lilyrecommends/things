## Fundamentals
  - 10 teams, 20 drivers, ~24 races per year
  - Points: 25 for win, 18 for 2nd, 15 for 3rd, down to 1 point for 10th
  - Fastest lap gets 1 bonus point (if you finish top 10)
  - Race weekend
    - Friday: Practice sessions (car setup)
    - Saturday: Qualifying (determines starting positions)
      - Q1: All 20 cars, slowest 5 eliminated
      - Q2: Remaining 15 cars, slowest 5 eliminated 
      - Q3: Final 10 cars fight for pole (1st place)
    - Sunday: Race (~300km or 2 hours max)
      - Hot lap: single fast lap at maximum speed for qualifying or practice times
  - Flags
    - Black: immediate disqualification
    - Red: immediate danger
    - White: slow-moving vehicle on the track e.g. emergency vehicle
    - Checkered: race start and end 
    - Yellow: caution advised
  - Laps
    - Formation: prior to official start
## Race Strategy
  - Must use 2 different tire types during race
    - Soft tires: Fast but wear out quickly
    - Medium tires: Balanced performance
    - Hard tires: Slower but last longer
  - Pit stops: Change tires, refuel (takes 2-3 seconds)
