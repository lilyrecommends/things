## Fundamentals
  - 10 teams, 20 drivers, ~24 races per year
  - Points: 25 for win, 18 for 2nd, 15 for 3rd, down to 1 point for 10th
  - Fastest lap gets 1 bonus point (if you finish top 10)
  - Race weekend
    - Friday: Practice sessions (car setup)
    - Saturday: Qualifying (determines starting positions)
      - Q1: all 20 cars, slowest 5 eliminated
      - Q2: remaining 15 cars, slowest 5 eliminated 
      - Q3: final 10 cars fight for pole (1st place)
    - Sunday: race (~300km or 2 hours max)
      - Hot lap: single fast lap at maximum speed for qualifying or practice times
      - Formation lap: prior to official start
  - Flags
    - Black: immediate disqualification
    - Red: immediate danger
    - White: slow-moving vehicle on the track e.g. emergency vehicle
    - Checkered: race start and end 
    - Yellow: caution advised
## Race Strategy
  - Must use 2 different tire compounds during race
    - Soft tires: fast, high grip, fast degradation
    - Medium tires: balanced
    - Hard tires: low grip, durable
  - Pit stops: change tires, refuel (takes 2-3 seconds)
  - [Increasing/decreasing radius](https://forums.kartpulse.com/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8e644a5a3d8a61c3f03bbf9e3eedf8d53b78e133.jpeg)
  - Fuel conservation
