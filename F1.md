## Fundamentals
  - 10 teams, 20 drivers, ~24 races per year
  - Points: 25 for win, 18 for 2nd, 15 for 3rd, down to 1 point for 10th
  - Fastest lap gets 1 bonus point (if you finish top 10)
  - Race weekend
    - _Friday_: practice sessions (car setup)
    - _Saturday_: qualifying (determines starting positions)
      - Q1: all 20 cars, slowest 5 eliminated
      - Q2: remaining 15 cars, slowest 5 eliminated 
      - Q3: final 10 cars fight for pole (1st place)
    - _Sunday_: race (~300km or 2 hours max)
      - Hot lap: single fast lap at maximum speed for qualifying or practice times
      - Formation lap: prior to official start
  - Flags
    - _Black_: immediate disqualification
    - _Red_: immediate danger
    - _White_: slow-moving vehicle on the track e.g. emergency vehicle
    - _Checkered_: race start and end 
    - _Yellow_: caution advised
## Race Strategy
  - Must use 2 different tire compounds during race
    - Soft tires (fast, high grip, fast degradation)
    - Medium tires (balanced)
    - Hard tires (low grip, durable)
  - Pit stops: change tires, refuel (takes 2-3 seconds)
  - [Increasing/decreasing radius](https://forums.kartpulse.com/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8e644a5a3d8a61c3f03bbf9e3eedf8d53b78e133.jpeg)
  - Fuel conservation

  - Hot track
    - Pit lane: used for maintenance of vehicles, driver changes, and other necessary actions
  - Cold track: when the track/pit is not being used by any vehicles
  - Run-off: several types of runoffs, such as Grass, gravel, sand or even an added section of tarmac
  - Chicane: serpentine (tight S- or Z-) curved road
  - Corkscrew: chicane with drop in elevation
  - Hairpins: 180° turns
  - Carousel: a circular shaped turn
  - Double apex: a corner/turn that is actually two turns
  - Straightaway: straight section
  - Parc fermé: closed park 
  - Paddock: restricted area behind the pit lane and garages where teams base their operations

## Components of a Racecar
[Explanation](https://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-racing/motorsports/formula-one2.htm)
  - _Chassis / monocoque_: shell onto which everything is bolted, composite (like spun carbon fibers set in resin or carbon fiber layered over aluminium mesh)
  - _Engine_: 2.4L V8 engines producing nearly 900hp to be rebuilt after 500 miles becuse they run at nearly 19,000rpm; fuel powering it uses about 50 different fuel blends tuned for different tracks or conditions 
  - _Transmission_: transfers all of the engine's power to the rear wheels, bolted directly onto the back of the engine, includes gearbox, differential, and driveshaft:
    - The gearbox must have a minimum of four foward gears and maximum of seven gears (total number includes forward, reverse, and neutral). 
    - The gearbox is connected to the [differential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYAw79386WI&pp=ygUYaG93IGEgZGlmZmVyZW50aWFsIHdvcmtz), gears allowing the rear wheels to revolve at different speeds during cornering. 
    - The differential is connected to the driveshaft, which powers the wheels. F1 drivers shift gears using the paddles  behind the wheel.
  - __Aerodynamics__
    - _Wings_ create downforce (as opposed to aircraft wings, which produce lift) to hold the car onto the track, especially during cornering. 
    - Engineers in the 1970s discovered the car itself could be a giant one with an undercarriage design creating an area of low pressure that sucks the entire vehicle downward (the "ground-effect")—today the bottom of the cars must be flat from the nose cone to the rear axle line. Most cars have a _diffuser_, an upward-sweeping device between the engine and gearbox that creates a suction effect as it funnels air up and passes it to the rear of the car. 
    - _Endplates_ are small, flanged (has a projecting rim)
