## Fundamentals
  • 10 teams, 20 drivers, ~24 races per year
  • Points: 25 for win, 18 for 2nd, 15 for 3rd, down to 1 point for 10th
  • Fastest lap gets 1 bonus point (if you finish top 10)
  • Race weekend
     •  Test

## Race Weekend
• Friday: Practice sessions (car setup)
• Saturday: Qualifying (determines starting positions)
• Sunday: Race (~300km or 2 hours max)

## Qualifying Format
• Q1: All 20 cars, slowest 5 eliminated
• Q2: Remaining 15 cars, slowest 5 eliminated  
• Q3: Final 10 cars fight for pole position (1st place start)

## Race Strategy
• Must use 2 different tire types during race
• Soft tires: Fast but wear out quickly
• Medium tires: Balanced performance
• Hard tires: Slower but last longer
• Pit stops: Change tires, refuel (takes 2-3 seconds)
• Strategy involves when to pit vs. staying out
