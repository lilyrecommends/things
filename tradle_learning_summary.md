# Tradle Learning Summary

## Core Strategy
Countries cluster into predictable economic archetypes based on geography, resources, and development level:

**Oil States**: Energy exports dwarf everything else (Saudi Arabia, Norway, Kuwait)
**Manufacturing Hubs**: Diverse industrial exports, often import raw materials (Germany, Japan, South Korea)
**Resource Extractors**: Dominated by one mineral/agricultural product (Chile copper, Ghana gold)
**City-States**: Re-export economies, services heavy (Singapore, Hong Kong)
**Agricultural Powerhouses**: Food exports match climate patterns (Brazil, Argentina, Australia)

## Analysis Framework
Both exports and imports reveal patterns - oil states import manufactured goods, manufacturing hubs import raw materials, island nations import fuel and food. The import side often confirms your archetype guess.

## Trade Volume by Economy Type

| Trade Volume | Oil States | Manufacturing | Resource Extraction | Agricultural | City-States |
|--------------|------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **$1T+** | Saudi Arabia | China, Germany, USA | - | - | - |
| **$500B-1T** | Russia | Japan, UK, France | - | - | - |
| **$100-500B** | UAE, Canada | South Korea, Italy | Australia, Brazil | - | Netherlands |
| **$50-100B** | Norway, Kuwait | Taiwan, Mexico | Chile, Indonesia | Argentina | Singapore |
| **$10-50B** | Algeria, Angola | Thailand, Vietnam | Peru, South Africa | Ukraine, New Zealand | - |
| **$5-15B** | Libya, Ecuador | - | Ghana, Zambia | Colombia, Uruguay | - |
| **<$5B** | Small oil states | - | Small miners | Small agricultural | - |

## Dead Giveaways (99% Confidence)
- **Saudi Arabia**: Oil 70%+, everything else tiny
- **Australia**: Iron ore + coal + gold dominant 
- **Singapore**: Refined petroleum + electronics + chemicals (city-state)
- **New Zealand**: Dairy + meat + wool (isolated agriculture)
- **Chile**: Copper 40-60% dominance
- **Norway**: Oil + fish + aluminum (wealthy cold country)

## Quick Elimination Rules
- **>60% single commodity** = resource extractor
- **Diverse manufacturing** = developed economy  
- **Refined petroleum prominent** = either oil producer or processing hub
- **Agricultural dominance** = check climate zone for crop type
- **Trade volume + pattern** = immediate country tier elimination

## Game Variants

### Connectrade
Groups products by the countries that export them, not thematic connections. Saint Martin exports: flavored water, coconuts/nuts, floating structures, scrap iron. Requires knowledge of specific country export profiles rather than logical product groupings.

### Pick 5
Identifies top 5 exporters of specific products. "Pharmaceutical Rubber Products" lesson: Thailand #1 ($308M), not Germany. Resource + manufacturing capability (rubber production + processing) trumps pure industry expertise (pharmaceutical R&D).

## Key Insights
1. **Systematic pattern recognition** + geographic logic + spaced repetition through daily play = steady improvement
2. **Resource + processing combinations** often beat pure expertise in specialized categories
3. **Trade volume constraints** immediately eliminate impossible options
4. **Geographic distance clues** help narrow regional possibilities
5. **Daily practice** with real puzzles teaches country-specific signatures that pure theory misses

## Common Analytical Errors
- Overweighting "prestigious" industries while underweighting raw material sources
- Assuming pharmaceutical expertise matters more than rubber supply chains
- Focusing on one part of compound categories ("pharmaceutical" vs "rubber")
- Ignoring geographic constraints from distance/direction feedback
