# Math
## Statistics
- finding patterns in uncertainty 
- the central limit theorem emerges from calculus (as sample size approaches infinity, distributions converge to predictable shapes)
- everything measurable varies (e.g. temperature, stock prices)

## Calculus
- tracking continuous infinitesimal change (and rates of change?) to find totals (integrals) or instantenous rates (derivatives) 
- [explanation](https://mathinsight.org/derivative_intuition)

    - function: consistent rule mapping inputs to outputs      
            given f(x) = 3x - 5  
            calculate:
            f(2) = ?
            f(x)=3(2)-5
            the **function value** at x = 2 is 1. f(2)=1.

    - integrals
        - a
    - derivative: instaneous
## Linear algebra
- mapping transformations between spaces
